# Writing first program

- The below program prints `Hello World` in the console.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  printf("Hello World\n");

  return 0;
}
```

- Save the above program as `Hello World.c`.
- Compile it with command `gcc Hello World.c`.
- A file name `a.out` will be generated.
- Run the file with `./a.out`.
- `Hello World` will be displayed on the console.

## Understanding the above code

### `#include <stdio.h`

- It is preprosser directive that comes as the first line of the program.
- All preprocessor commands starts from `#`.
- `#include` tells the compiler to include the standard input/output library or header file `stdio.h` in the program.
- This files has some built-in functions and by including this file we can directly use these funcitons.
- `stdio.h` contains the functions for input and output of data like reading values from the keyboard and printing the results on the screen.

### `int main()`

- This is the main function of the C program from where the execution of code begins.
- `int` is the return type which tells us that this function return integer value.
- After all the statements of the progr

### `printf()`

- This function is defined in the `stdio.h` file and is used to print text in the console.

### `\n`

- It is an escape sequence which specifies to go to a new line after printing.

### `return 0`

- Return command used to return the value `0` to the OS giving indication that there were no errors during the execution.
